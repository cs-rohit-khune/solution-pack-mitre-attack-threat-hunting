# Usage

Refer to [Simulate Scenario documentation](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/solution-pack-soc-simulator/blob/develop/docs/solution-pack-guide.md) to understand how to simulate and reset scenarios. 
 
To understand the process FortiSOAR follows to respond to phishing emails, we have included following scenarios with this solution pack. Refer to the subsequent sections to understand how this solution pack's automation addresses your needs.


## MITRE ATT&CK&reg; - Access Token Manipulation

This scenario demonstrates threat hunting for the attacks using the MITRE technique Access Token Manipulation [T1134] and generates corresponding demo Hunt, Alert, and corresponding Technique/Sub-Technique records.

## MITRE ATT&CK&reg; - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution

This scenario demonstrates threat hunting for the attacks using MITRE technique Boot or Login Autostart Execution [T1547] and generates corresponding demo Hunt, Alert, and corresponding Technique/Sub-Technique records.

## MITRE ATT&CK&reg; - Credential Access

This scenario demonstrates threat hunting for the attacks using the MITRE technique OS Credential Dumping [T1003] and generates demo Hunt, Alert, and Technique/Sub-Technique records.

## MITRE ATT&CK&reg; - Defense Evasion

The scenario demonstrates threat hunting for the attacks using MITRE technique Exploitation for Defense Evasion and generates demo Hunt, Alert, and Technique/Sub-Technique records.

## MITRE ATT&CK&reg; - Event Triggered Execution

The scenario demonstrates threat hunting for the attacks using the MITRE technique Event-Triggered Execution [T1546] and generates demo Hunt, Alert, and Technique/Sub-Technique records.

## MITRE ATT&CK&reg; - Process Execution

The scenario demonstrates threat hunting for the attacks using MITRE technique Process Execution and generates demo Hunt, Alert, and Technique/Sub-Technique records.

## MITRE ATT&CK&reg; - Signed Binary Proxy Execution

The scenario demonstrates threat hunting for the attacks using the MITRE technique Signed Binary Proxy Execution [T1218] and generates demo Hunt, Alert, and Technique/Sub-Technique records

Navigate to generated alerts and observe the following:

- Following MITRE technique information is available as a handy reference
    - MITRE ID
    - MITRE Technique
    - MITRE Sub-Technique
- Following attack details is available for analyzing the case
    - Process ID
    - Process Name
    - File Path
    - Computer Name

Navigate to generated hunt and observe that a summarized information of all the linked alerts is available in the comments.
